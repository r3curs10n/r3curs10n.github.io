In this post you'll learn how to use asides (also known as "admonitions") included in this theme. Sometimes they are also called "callouts". They are useful for displaying secondary information alongside a page's main content.

By default, this theme gives you four asides:

- Note
- Caution
- Tip
- Danger

You can use them like so in your MDX files:

````mdx
:::note
This is text inside a note.
:::

You can also use custom titles:

:::caution[Watch out!]
This is a warning message!
:::

:::tip
Here's what 10 tips taught me about B2B.

```ts
const hello = 'world'
```
:::

:::danger
Do not visit LinkedIn.
:::
````

Here's a preview of how they look:
